The task manager application is a web-based tool designed to help users organize and manage their tasks effectively. It comprises three main components: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML: The HTML file structures the web page, providing input fields for the task title, description, and due date. It includes buttons for adding tasks and sections for filtering and sorting the task list. The layout is simple and user-friendly, ensuring ease of use.

CSS: The CSS file styles the application, making it visually appealing and easy to interact with. It uses a clean, modern design with responsive elements, such as centered alignment and styled buttons. The CSS also includes animations for a smooth user experience, enhancing the overall look and feel of the application.

JavaScript: The JavaScript file is the core of the application's functionality. It handles adding, editing, deleting, filtering, and sorting tasks. Event listeners capture user actions, triggering functions that dynamically update the task list in the DOM. Tasks are stored in the browser's localStorage, allowing them to persist across sessions. The script ensures that tasks are displayed correctly and updated immediately based on user inputs. Functions are used to manage the tasks, including saving, loading, filtering by title or due date, and sorting alphabetically or by due date.

Overall, this application provides a comprehensive solution for task management, combining an intuitive interface with robust functionality.# Task-manager
